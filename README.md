 This was very straight forward without any itch.I used CSS Grid in structuring the main part of the page(the post gallery) making it as responsive as possible without so much altering with media queries.

 As in the last challenge, I decided to account for other screen sizes apart from the required mobile phone and laptop views.

You can checkout the [demo](https://g-gallery.netlify.app/).
